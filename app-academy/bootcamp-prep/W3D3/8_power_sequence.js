/***********************************************************************
Write a function `powerSequence(base, length)` that takes in two numbers,
`base` and `length`. The function should return an array containing a
power sequence with the given `length`. Assume that the `length` is at
least 1.

The first number of a power sequence begins with `base`. The second
number of the sequence is the product between the first number and the
base. The third number of the sequence is the product between the second
number and the base...

function powerSequence(base, length) {
    var result = [];
  for(var i = 1; i < length; i++){
            if(result.length < 1) result.push(base);
            result.push(base * result[i - 1]);
  }
    return result;
}

console.log(powerSequence(3, 4)); // => [ 3, 9, 27, 81 ]
console.log(powerSequence(2, 6)); // => [ 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 ]
console.log(powerSequence(8, 3)); // => [ 8, 64, 512 ]
